## General info
Applying EDA techniques to draw insight from the Tumor Diagnosis dataset.


## Project description
This project is an application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. 
In this notebook you will be introduced to the key concepts in exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations to identify and interpret inherent relationships in the data set, produce various chart types including histograms, violin plots, box plots, joint plots, pair grids, and heatmaps, customize plot aesthetics and apply faceting methods to visualize higher dimensional data.

	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* jupyter-notebook : 6.0.3
* Python: 3.8.3
* Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Dataset: The Breast Cancer Diagnostic data is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server.

	
## Setup
Just download or clone this repository, open the notebook using Jupyter-notebook or Google Colab and run the cells0
